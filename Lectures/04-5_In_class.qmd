## Timeline

![](../images/QM_PC.png)


## (Not) Quoting Column Names

> When it comes to using a title of a column in a string of code, we either put them in "" or we do not. Is there a cheat sheet or something that we know when to do either one? I have been using trial and error and hoping for the best.

- Base R: Usually, except for `$`
- Tidyverse: Usually not


## Sampling

> In my research, I measure cell length after deleting one gene and I usually work with thousand of cells. But I often skip the cells that are joined together because they are hard to measure. Does this mean my sample is not random anymore? How does this affect the probability of my results being accurate or representative of the real population?


## Sample size {.smaller}

> How are statistical analyses impacted by smaller samples sizes, and how can we, as scientists, maximize our validity despite having smaller samples sizes? I think I understand that usually the higher the n, the better we can estimate true probability which helps with wider application, but I'm curious about other methods.

> How significantly does a difference of sample size matter when comparing two samples? In my research I'm comparing the data collected at two different sites but one is much larger than the other and I'm curious if this would skew the data too much and require the samples be narrowed down to only compare factors with more similar proportions.



## Many ways to solve a coding problem

> In problem set 3 our group used mutate rather than summarize to get the richness info.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

richness <- comp |>
  group_by(subplot, plot_no) |>
  mutate(richness = length(unique(species))) #what we did in our project
```

> How is this different/superior to the summarize? I guess I don't understand why you would use summarize rather than just adding new columns of info.


## When to make a new object

> When joining tables in R, is it necessary (or recommended) to rename the resulting joined table? I previously (PS 3) used the same name (“richness”) for the newly joined table as one of the original tables, and I encountered problems when creating a plot. After renaming the joined table, the issue was resolved. Is renaming important to avoid such problems in later analyses?


## Distributions {.smaller}

> Since several distributions can look similar in a histogram (slides 21-24 class 04-4 Distributions), what are the best practical steps to decide whether my data are better modeled as normal, binomial, or Poisson. Should I base it mainly on how the data are generated (continuous mass vs. counts vs. successes out of trials), or are there simple diagnostic checks I should use to confirm?

> When working with large numerical datasets, how can we determine whether the data follow a normal distribution? Is there a statistical method to test whether a dataset is normally distributed, even if the experimental design suggests that the data should be approximately normal? Or should we simply assume normality based on the study design?

> Do we choose the distribution type we look at based on the data we collect? Or is the distribution something that innately results from our data?


## Genetic similarity

> What are some ways that genetic similarity or genetic variation can affect a distribution. For example if everything shares one parent what shape or how should a distribution be normalized?

- Coming soon and in Unit 12


## Quiz Review

- 4-2
- 4-3


## Conditional Probability {.smaller}

> I am not sure about the meaning of Pr[B|A] in Pr[A|B]= Pr[B|A] x Pr[A]/Pr[B]. If the probability of B depends on the probability of A, why can the probability of B affect the probability of A? Like why would the probability of bringing an umbrella can affect the probability of rain?

> How can I interpret probabilities when some events seem to be dependent rather than independent? Many variables in my data affect each other and probability calculations might be misleading if I assume independence. For example, if a nightjar vocalizes, it is more likely to vocalize again or entice another bird to call; if it's raining they call less; and if its after sunset they call more.

- Interactions coming soon


## Exploratory Data Analysis

> In my experience, initial data visualization is not a priority. It is honestly only this class where I have been encouraged to just look at the data, then tidy it up to make it more manageable for analysis. Is this anyone else's experience? Or have most people been encouraged to initially do this?


## Transformations

> When is it acceptable/necessary to log transform data?


## Binomial probabilities

About 10% of people are left handed.

- What is the probability of exactly 0 left handed people in a *random sample* of 24?
- What is the probability of exactly 1?
- What is the probability of 1 *or more*?


## Binomial probabilities

Probability density functions in R: `dbinom()`, `dnorm()`, `dpois()`, etc.

`dbinom(x, size, prob)`

- `x` = Number of "successes"
- `size` = Sample size
- `prob` = Probability of success for each trial


## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of *exactly* 0 left handed people in a *sample* of 24?

```{r}
#| eval: false

dbinom(0, 24, prob = 0.1)
```


## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of *exactly* 0 left handed people in a *sample* of 24?

```{r}
#| echo: true

dbinom(0, 24, prob = 0.1)
```


## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of exactly 1?


## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of exactly 1?

```{r}
#| echo: true

dbinom(1, 24, prob = 0.1)
```


## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of 1 *or more*?


## Binomial probabilities

What is the probability of 1 *or more*?

```{r}
#| echo: true

sum(dbinom(1:24, 24, prob = 0.1))
```

*"or more"* is critical here for hypothesis testing:

- Probability of the observed data or any *more extreme*


## Binomial probabilities for Pr[left] = 0.1

```{r}
M <- tibble(Lefties = 0:24, Probability = dbinom(0:24, 24, prob = 0.1))

ggplot(M, aes(Lefties, Probability)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "n Left-handers") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 5))
```

$n > 8$ have very low probabilities.


## Binomial probabilities for Pr[left] = 0.1

```{r}
M <- tibble(Lefties = 0:24, Probability = dbinom(0:24, 24, prob = 0.1)) |>
  mutate(log_Prob = log10(Probability))

ggplot(M, aes(Lefties, log_Prob)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "n Left-handers", y = "log10 Probability") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 5))
```


## Powerball

1. 69 balls in pool #1: Choose 5
1. 26 in the pool #2: Choose 1

Number of winning combinations in pool 1 is the **binomial coefficient**


## Binomial coefficient

- the number of unique ordered sequences of successes that yield exactly $k$ successes from $n$ trials ("n choose k").
- the "successes" can happen in any order
- `choose(n, k)`

$$\left({n\atop k}\right)=\frac{n!}{k!\left(n - k\right)!}$$

```{r}
#| echo: true

choose(3, 2)
```


## Powerball

1. 69 balls in pool #1: Choose 5
1. 26 in the pool #2: Choose 1

```{r}
#| echo: true

choose(69, 5)
choose(26, 1)
```


## Powerball

5 successes from 69 chances $\times$ 1 success from 26 chances.

```{r}
#| echo: true

choose(69, 5) * choose(26, 1)
1 / (choose(69, 5) * choose(26, 1))
```

What if the order had to be correct as well?


## When should I buy a ticket?

*Expected value*: "average" value of a ticket

- Each ticket costs $2

```{r}
#| echo: true

2 * (choose(69, 5) * choose(26, 1))
```

Expected value is >$2 when the jackpot is >$584,402,676


## Practicing Bayes Rule {.smaller}

> I'm having trouble with keeping track of the different probabilities in Bayes rule. It can get a bit confusing when trying to figure out which value is the prior, which is conditional, and what goes in the denominator. Is there some sort of standard method or procedure we should follow when setting up Bayes rule calculations?

> I haven’t taken math or stats in a couple years and I need to review it. I also got a little turned around on which values went where on the smallpox/chicken pox example. Are there any additional practice resources you would recommend?


## Breast cancer screening

Approximately correct numbers:

1. 1 in 100 women in the age range 40-50 have breast cancer
2. 20% with cancer have a negative mammogram (*false negative*)
3. 90% without cancer have a negative mammogram (*true negative*)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Question

What is the probability of a randomly sampled woman having breast cancer, given a negative test?
:::

## Breast cancer screening

$$Pr[C|N] = \frac{False~Negatives}{False~Negatives + True~Negatives}$$

$$Pr[C|N] = \frac{Pr[N|C] \times Pr[C]}{Pr[N]}$$


## Breast cancer screening

- 100 women
- 1 has cancer, 99 do not
- How many overall will get a negative test?

With cancer: 1 * 0.2 = 0.2


Without cancer: 99 * 0.9 = 89.1


Total negative tests: 0.2 + 89.1 = 89.3

Probability of having cancer, given negative test:

```{r}
#| echo: true

0.2 / 89.3
```


## Breast cancer screening

Approximately correct numbers:

1. 1 in 100 women in the age range 40-50 have breast cancer
2. 80% with cancer have a positive mammogram (true positives)
3. 10% without cancer have a positive mammogram (false positives)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Question

What is the probability of a randomly sampled woman having breast cancer, given a positive test?
:::


## Breast cancer screening

$$Pr[C|T] = \frac{Pr[T|C] \times Pr[C]}{Pr[T]}$$

- $Pr[T|C] = 0.8$
- $Pr[C] = 1/100 = 0.01$
- $Pr[T]$ = ???


## Breast cancer screening

$$Pr[C|T] = \frac{Pr[T|C] \times Pr[C]}{Pr[T]}$$

- $Pr[T|C] = 0.8$
- $Pr[C] = 1/100 = 0.01$
- $Pr[T] = (0.8 \times 0.01) + (0.1 \times 0.99)$


## Breast cancer screening

$$Pr[C|T] = \frac{Pr[T|C] \times Pr[C]}{Pr[T]}$$

- $Pr[T|C] = 0.8$
- $Pr[C] = 0.01$
- $Pr[T] = (0.8 \times 0.01) + (0.1 \times 0.99)$

```{r}
#| echo: true

(0.8 * 0.01) / ((0.8 * 0.01) + (0.1 * 0.99))
```
