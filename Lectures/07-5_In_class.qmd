## Problem Set 6: Pseudocode

> I found developing the loop for making the plots in problem set 6 to be challenging. I understand the basic structure of a loop and pseudo code in general, but am confused on how to determine if an object is a string and how to properly assign the output of the loop to the 'ii'. 

> Can we go over what pseudocode is? I understood that pseudocode is a kind of workflow for coding, but I didn't understand anything beyond that. I also had a hard time connecting pseudocode to the looping question in PS6.


## Confidence Intervals

> I think I'm a little confused about what confidence intervals actually tell us. Does not not tell us anything about probability? I know it tells us the percent of time values of the mean fall within the interval, but I'm just a little confused about it overall.

> Could we go over quiz 7-1?


## Questions confidence intervals can't answer

- The *probability* that the true mean is greater than 0 is at least 95%.
- The *probability* that the true mean equals 0 is smaller than 5%
- There is a 95% *probability* that the true mean lies between 0.1 and 0.4.
- The "null *hypothesis*" that the true mean equals 0 is likely to be incorrect.


## Question confidence intervals can answer

- If we were to *repeat* the *experiment* over and over, then in 95% of the trials, the confidence intervals *will contain the true mean*.


## Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests

> Are confidence intervals and p-values interrelated? It seems like they are as I was learning this week, but if so why would a CI be superior to P value? Perhaps I am a bit fuzzy on it.

> Is there a connection between the confidence interval and the p-value (as one can inform the other), or are these separate tests providing supporting information about our data and hypothesis?


## Making Decisions

> If the t-statistic was closer to the critical value but still below it, would that change how we interpret our results?

> How do you know when to reject a null hypothesis? what do you rely on in your data to make that decision?


## Test statistics, P-values, and Hypothesis tests

> I am a little confused about the purpose of the t distribution and the t statistic. I understand that the t statistics allows us to compare our data's mean to a model population mean. And that we can find the p value as the area of part of the curve. But it feels abstract, and I'm not sure what we can conclude from knowing these things. How do we know that the t statistic is significant? Can we only find a p value if we can make a t distribution, and thus have a model/predicted mean to compare our mean to? How do we know we can make a t distribution, a linear model, or a normal distribution with our data?
