## Today's plan

- Progress check reminder
- Big picture framework & questions
- Practice with likelihood (which will answer some of your questions)
- Return for likelihood examples and discussion


## Unit 5 Goals

- How do we learn about the world as scientists? What are our conclusions based on?


## Models

> I still feel slightly foggy on what a "model" is. Is it the equation/calculation you do or is it a set of data you compare against?


## From data to inference via models

- Many paths from data to inference
- No one way is best or uniquely correct

## Hands-on Practice

- Use lecture slides (& captions) & your notes
- Focus on understanding each step & specific things you do not understand
- Work for 30 minutes, then regroup


## Maximizing through optimization

- 5 heads from 20 coin flips

What is the maximum likelihood estimate of $Pr[Heads]$

```{r}
#| echo: true

log_lik <- function(theta, heads, flips) {
  dbinom(heads, flips, prob = theta, log = TRUE)
}

log_lik(0.5, 5, 20)
dbinom(5, 20, prob = 0.5, log = TRUE)
```


## Maximizing through optimization

```{r}
#| echo: true

optim(par = 0.5,
      fn = log_lik,
      heads = 5,
      flips = 20,
      method = "Brent",
      lower = 0, upper = 1,
      control = list(fnscale = -1))
```


## Maximizing through optimization

```{r}
#| echo: true
40/87
dbinom(40, 87, prob  = 40/87, log = TRUE)
optim(par = 0.5,
      fn = log_lik,
      heads = 40,
      flips = 87,
      method = "Brent",
      lower = 0, upper = 1,
      control = list(fnscale = -1))
```


## Applications of likelihoods

In addition to being a gateway to understanding likelihood in general...

- Predicting inheritance of traits
- Predicting pollination success
- Predicting drug efficacy (antibiotics inhibiting bacterial colony growth)
- Predator success
- Survival (e.g., tagged animals)


## Uses of binomial likelihoods

- Model comparison
    - New technique has 80% success compared to old technique with 60% success. Is it really better?
- Quantifying uncertainty with confidence intervals (coming soon)
- Generalized linear models and logistic regression (Unit 12)


## Mark-Recapture Experiments

1. Capture and mark a set of individuals
2. Wait
3. Capture a second set of individuals
4. Count the number of recaptured individuals


## Mark-Recapture Experiments

```{r}
#| echo: true

M <- 50 # n 1st capture
n <- 30 # n 2nd capture
x <- 15 # n Recaptured
```

Log-likelihood function to find N

```{r}
#| echo: true

NLL <- function(N) {
  p <- M / N  # Probability of capturing a marked individual
  return(-dbinom(x, n, p, log = TRUE))
}

```


## ML Estimation

```{r}
#| echo: true

N_ML_est <- optim(par = M + n,
               fn = NLL,
               method = "Brent",
               lower = M + 1,
               upper = 1000)
(N_est <- N_ML_est$par)
```


## Visualization

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

Pred <- tibble(N = seq(M + 1, 300, by = 1),
               log_Lik = sapply(N, function(N) exp(-NLL(N))))

ggplot(Pred,
       aes(x = N, y = log_Lik)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkblue", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = N_est, color = "firebrick4", linetype = "dotted",
             linewidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(50, 300, by = 50)) +
  labs(x = "Estimated Population Size (N)",
       y = "Likelihood")

```
